1. Environment Check
   - Ensure all traffic originates from approved domains
   - Force HTTPS on landing pages + hop links
   - If referer NOT equal to your domain → reject & log

2. Link Integrity Enforcement
   On page load:
       Extract affiliate hop link parameters
       Compare against stored, verified affiliate ID
       IF hoplink.id != ExpectedID
           Alert admin + rewrite to original ID

3. Session-Level Validation
   For each visitor:
       Generate hash token for tracking
       Bind token to:
          - browser fingerprint
          - IP block
          - ClickBank affiliate ID
       IF token integrity fails at checkout
          Flag as data-hijack attempt

4. Server-Side Reporting Mirror
   - Create internal sales ledger copy
   - Sync inbound clicks, order form impressions, rebills
   - Compare with ClickBank dashboard records

   IF variance > threshold
      Trigger FRAUD / DIVERSION ALERT
      Log timestamp, IP, funnel step

5. Admin Login Security
   - Enable 2FA on ClickBank login
   - Rotate passwords every 30–60 days
   - Detect unusual login locations

   IF login originates outside trusted region
       Auto-lock dashboard + notify owner

6. Outbound Data Protection
   - Block unknown scripts from modifying hop links
   - Disallow external JS injection
   - Audit site weekly for iframe or cloaked redirects

7. Escalation Procedure
   IF repeat diversion attempts detected
       A) Lock affected hoplinks
       B) Regenerate encrypted links
       C) Report to ClickBank support security team
       D) Start forensic log trace
